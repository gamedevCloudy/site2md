Blast from the Past: Reviving the Classic Bomberman Game in AR for Jio Glass
- Aayush Chaudhary
Situation
I was approached by Jio Glass to create an AR game for their Mixed Reality Glasses. I attended a meeting with their developer relations manager and became intrigued by the platform. After discussing some ideas, we agreed to create an AR version of Bomber Man for the Jio Glass platform.
The Task
Given the unique capabilities of the Jio Glass platform, my goal was to create an AR game that would be both engaging and showcase the capabilities of the platform.
I initially considered creating an AR version of the classic NES game Duck Hunt, but ultimately settled on creating an AR version of Bomber Man, an arcade classic known for its challenging gameplay and dynamic boss battles. The game, titled "Bomber Boy", would have three different worlds, over 30 levels, and several boss battles.
Action
The initial development of the game's demo and alpha were straightforward. However, as the concept expanded, creating content for the game became increasingly challenging. I worked hard to ensure that each level provided a unique and challenging gameplay experience while showcasing the unique capabilities of the Jio Glass platform.
As development progressed, the game caught the interest of stakeholders at Jio Glass, and the internal team joined me in developing the game as it neared completion and release.
Result
"Bomber Boy" is a casual AR arcade game with three different worlds, over 30 levels, and challenging boss battles. The game was developed for the Jio Glass platform, with a focus on showcasing the unique capabilities of the platform.
Despite the challenges that came with creating content for the game, the final product is engaging and fun, and has generated significant interest among stakeholders.
We have ensured that the game is of high quality. The game is still under development and is expected to ship with the first few games when Jio Glass launches. I am proud to have been able to create a game that will be enjoyed by Jio Glass users and I am excited to see it in action once the platform is launched.
