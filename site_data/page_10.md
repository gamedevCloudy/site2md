Machine Learning
Hello, I'm Aayush👋🏻
a programmer and deep-learning student
I like to create: it can be software, games, pixel art or videos.
I ran a game studio part-time. I have one
game published
with
Jio Tesseract
and some prototypes tested in
            collaboration with
YSO Corp and Moonee.
And one high-profile client(
did not go well
). It hasn't been a super successful endeavour, but I've learnt a
            lot in the process.
I'm focusing on honing my deep learning skills to contribute
            effectively to AI-focused organizations.
