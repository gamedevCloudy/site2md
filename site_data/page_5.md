Dungeon Crawler with a Twist: How We Made Dice Shot in Under 48 Hours
- Aayush Chaudhary
Situation
I was part of a 3-person team that created a game called "Dice Shot" for the GMTK game jam with the theme of "Roll of the Dice".
The Task
As the lead programmer, my responsibilities included creating the difficulty system, player controller, and randomized health and ammo system. I also led the team and oversaw project management.
Action
collaborated closely with Vivek, our 3D artist, and Ritesh, our other programmer, to ensure that their work aligned with my designs. I also utilized my leadership and project management skills to keep our team organized and on track, despite the intense 48-hour time constraint.
Result
"Dice Shot" was well-received, receiving positive reviews from players and game jam judges alike. My leadership and project management skills proved to be essential in helping our team create a game that ranked among the top 30% of all entries.
Our game was up against 6,000 other entries and ranked 1710th overall, with specific rankings in presentation(#1520), enjoyment(#1811), and creativity(#2036).
