House Paint
From Intern to Full-Time Jr. Programmer: Developing a House Painting Game with Complex Redemption System and RMG Integrations
- Aayush Chaudhary
Situation
Zippy Creative, our game development studio, received a client project for a mid-core casual game called "House Paint."
The project was led by Shailja Shrivastava, the founder and senior developer. As a intern programmer at the studio, I was tasked with creating a shop system for the game.
The Task
In the first month, I worked on the basic shop system, while other team members focused on developing gameplay mechanics. The next month, I focused on polishing the entire game.
And after that I developed the shop and redemption systems further and would integrate seamlessly. Subsequently, I worked closely with Shailja to integrate several custom SDKs for analytics, a redemption system, and other custom events as required by client.
Action
Over the course of the nine-month project, I quickly demonstrated my high-level programming skills and ability to understand the underlying functionality of various software development kits (SDKs). With this  developed a shop and redemption system that allowed players to redeem money into their PayPal account or receive Robux.
Throughout the project, I became extremely skilled in building iOS games using Unity and Xcode, as development required continuous test builds. I also excelled at working closely with the team and collaborating with the founder, Shilaja, to ensure that the shop and redemption systems were integrated into the game seamlessly.
Result
Over the nine-month project, I not only demonstrated my high-level programming skills and ability to develop systems for games, but I also became an essential team member. Resulting in my transition from an intern to a full-time Jr. Programmer.
My contributions played a vital role in ensuring the success of the "House Paint" game. The project ultimately showcased my talents in programming, game development, and iOS development, and provided me with a unique opportunity to hone my skills in a professional setting.
